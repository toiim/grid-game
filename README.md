# grid-game

This is a small turn-based game written in Vue and using XState for its state machines. Each team has a few characters they can move around the grid and perform certain actions. It's reminiscent of tactics games like Famicom Wars or Fire Emblem.

## Ideas

- Add stamina to entities
- Add command points to player turns (limits number of units used)
- Add deployment at beginning of game
- Daily puzzle
- Stamina used to auto dodge
- Stamina used to move or attack
- Tiers/puzzles based on command points
- Prizes higher in higher puzzles
